## Repository anatomy

| Directory | Description                                                                            |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app       | Yew.rs frontend application.                                                           |
| server    | Rust REST API that uses MongoDB as database.                                           |
| lib       | A rust crate that contains some types and functionality that 'app' and 'server' share. |

## Development status
This project is primarily a hobby project for personal use, and not recommended to use in production. It is also a work in progress and I may still make breaking changes to the interface and data models until the application is released as v1

## Encryption
All files and data are end-to-end encrypted, with a few small exceptions. All encryption is done with AES using a 256-bit key.

### What is not encrypted?
The following information is not encrypted, and/or can be determined by someone with full access to the database and storage:
- File size in bytes of each photo
- Usernames and password hashes
- When and how often a user has logged in

## Docker
A docker image is available.

```docker pull ghcr.io/eliefaart/upholi/upholi:latest```

A docker compose file is included in the repo to run the image, but you will still need to set up a MongoDB database server yourself.

## Server configuration
Default configuration is inside ```/server/config/default.toml```. Each setting can also be set using environment variables. Environment variables overwrite the settings from the default config file.
